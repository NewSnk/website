        this week we started pcb design, something i'm super interested in but definitely
        have no experience. i started with high hopes of making a pcb that guides my final
        project which includes 4 motors and many leds, but i decided for this week to just
        do a simple pcb that breaks out the xiao board, similar to the <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/leon/students/adrian-torres/fabxiao.html">design</a> 
        shared in class created by adrian torres. <br><br>
        
        i started by downloading <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">kicad</a> and downloading
        the <a href="https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics/kicad/-/blob/master/README.md">fab electronics library for kicad</a>
        which contains a helpful list of parts that the fab labs at mit keep in stock.

        i just wanted to do a basic board that had a few connectors, an rgb led, and a switch,
        potentially to continue developing my zipper idea from before, but i downgraded my idea even further when i started to realize how much
        i had to learn.
    
        so i started by mocking up the design in kicad with only three parts, i used an rp2040, included a switch, an rgb led, and a 7-pin connector. 
    </p>
    <p>
        
        i started on the rgb led board by arranging components in kicad, arranging in the pcb editor, and producing
        a traces and outline png for use in <a href="https://modsproject.org/">mods project</a>.

        i wanted to also practice milling throughholes so i made the design such that i could either
        solder the smd rgb led on the pads or i could use the throughholes to use the common rgb led also.
    
        milling traces on the roland went super smoothly (i love the roland!) and then i went to upload the 
        outline and throughholes files. i assumed that we would call the throughholes outlines and mill them
        that way, and indeed roland does work that way, but the throughholes that i had made on kicad were too
        small. they weren't recognized as solvable with the 1/32nd endmill. you can see that the toolpath only
        recognizes the larger throughholes defined on the microcontroller. 
    </p>
    <img style = width:40%; src = "media/week5/throughholes.png">
    <img style = width:29%; src = "media/week5/throughholes-2.png">
    <p>      
        there were two solution options, the first was to just mill the smaller holes (but the rgb led legs wouldn't fit),
        by adjusting the tool size and changing the endmill, which is nice to know. 
    </p>
    <img style = width:30%; src = "media/week5/throughholes-1.png">
    <p>
        i ended up milling the throughholes with the 1/64" endmill as a test and also with the 1/32nd
        endmill. then i moved to soldering. <br><br>

        the biggest design flaw was my use of the under-board ground pad. i tried and tried and tried
        to solder it to the board but not only was i unsucessful, i ripped the copper off the backing and
        ruined the pad entirely. but never fear, i just soldered a jumper wire from ground to the button pad. 
    </p>

    <p>
        my solders are getting better and i'm getting better at flowing between components and finding
        it quite satisfying. the smaller components were actually not hard to solder with a fine tip and 
        that was quite a nice realization (that i can do this!). <br><br>

        the board came together in around 10 minutes. <br>

        notice here that i used the same size resisitor (1k ohm) for each data leg of the rgb led. i know
        that this isn't appropriate (that the red leg needs to be sized differently) but we didn't have a large
        range of resistors in the lab so i couldn't size it appropriately and will figure it out programmaticly.
        <br><br>
        
        it works! <br><br>

        <a href="media/week5/blink-rgb-led.ino">here</a> is my code! i used the arduino ide for this project.
