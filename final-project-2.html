        my inspiration for my final project is this note delivery system i saw being used in 
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silverfuture_bar/">a bar</a> in Berlin. Each table at
        the bar has a number assigned to it and they set up a pulley system that drags around a loop
        that has strings with clothespins on it. Each table can write notes anonymously or otherwise
        to the others around the room by labeling them with the table number. <br><br>

        i'm really interested in studying how technology can enhance face-to-face or even create new
        ways of human physical interaction, and i thought this was a nice example of that - instead
        of having each table be insular and little interaction with the room, the entire place turned 
        inwards and started to get to know eachother, to exchange numbers and looks and laughs, and the
        bar was busier than i had ever seen it. <br><br>

        because i'm also really into objects with hidden identies or spaces that make the viewer feel
        like they've discovered something all to themselves, i want to combine these concepts for my final
        project. the idea is to make these roaming sculptures that navigate around the ceiling, and are 
        interesting enough to be purely decoration, but also can be called upon for note receipt and delivery to
        identified locations in the space. <br><br>

        visually for this application, i want to create a sculptural object that captures the kitschy vibe similar to this from
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cubbyholebar/?hl=en">cubbyhole</a> in new york city and the etherial, 
        blobby, space & organic feelings from this piece called Lunar Landscape by Isamu Noguchi.

        the design of the mechanism is quite tricky as in visioning, i want multiple (30?) of these
        robots to be able to move around the grid, so a simple cnc would not work, and because they hang 
        down, many other designs are unfeasible as well.<br><br>

        the design that i think will work the best is a simple gear and pinion system in two two-dimensions
        that allow the element to hang under the framing and be pulled in both x and y directions. this design
        means that the entire middle can be routed out while allowing for stability and movement.

        you can see that many iterations were made to envision a few ideas, including a few more 
        ridiculous ideas (together with Leo and Quentin), but for now i've settled on a gear and 
        rack system in two directions so that the object can hang underneath the extrusion and move 
        in two-dimensions at the intersections.

        i tried to mock this up in fusion360 parametrically, but realized that i was still moreso in the 
        idea and playing around stage then was i really able to parametrize - i tried but i started running
        into more constraints than i thought. this may be an indicator that the original vision doesn't work
        so well, but for now i have a mocked up version that appears like it could work in 3d space. 

        quick drawings of the distributed call boxes and the receptacle mechanism are below. i'm 
        thinking of trying to either do the pneumatic receptacle, or just the paperclip for simplicitity and cuteness.

        you can see that i've tried to envision a system that provides support, x and y directional movement,
        and leaves the bottom open so that a note can come down. it's proving very difficult and hopefully some
        additional eyes can shed some light! <br><br>

        so obviously, i'm working on designing this component this week, but to complete
        the project before the it's due, i'm hoping to follow this approximate schedule.

        as for how the note is recieved into the element, i'm picturing a pulled system that extends 
        down when it reaches its location and allows for a note to be deposited. in class and outside of class we discussed the concept of
        the <a href="https://hangprinter.org/">hangprinter</a>, or a cnc controller by the spinning of 3 or more rotors to increase and decrease the lengths
        of threads held at tension to move an object around in 3d dimension space. the benefits of this method are that the size of the printer becomes
        constrained by the size of the room which is exciting. i decided to pursue this approach.<br><br>
        
        i started by designing the mechanisms in cad. first i knew that for the demonstration i would need idlers to mount to the sides of the frames so that i could
        hold the position in 3d space. i started in fusion360 and designed this piece that would hold M5 screws, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08X2SX1GL?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">idlers</a> 
        and slot directly to the aluminum extrusion left over from machine week.

    <p>
        the other main mechanical component for the machine is spinners that can be attached to the heads of the motors. i came up with this design that snap fits to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088BG2QFG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">nema 17 motors</a>
        that i had ordered. i designed a bracket that would fit directly over the screw holes in the motors and firmly secure it to a sidewall.

        i designed the noguchi object that i wanted to be moving around the room in blendr. i wanted it to be hollow hydrostone with holes in it where light could escape.

    <p>
        finally, i designed an extrusion cage to hold the components and put it all together in cad.

        i started 3d printing because there was quite a rush at the reef. for the orb object, i wanted to make it big, and printed out the shape with the intention of oomooing the 
        positive side in a box. i asked around for oomoo but the size was a little bit too much so i downsized and printed a smaller version, and laser cut a box to fit it perfectly for 
        oomoo.
