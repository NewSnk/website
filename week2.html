        week two started out with a bang (not least because i started on the
        waitlist!) but also because we began with an orientation joints and joinery, 
        looking at different methods of combining materials and debating their advantages 
        and disadvantages.<br>
        
        the assignment this week was to build a friction-fit cardboard object using the 
        lasercutter and also to produce a vinyl-cut design, but ALSO to build a website
        to showcase our work and discuss the challenges. <br><br>

        we work on a single repo on gitlab with the rest of the class, and for me this was
        a first foray into web-building. i have lots of questions and lots to learn.
        
        but, back to design! like last week, i started with pen and paper.

        i decided to design and build a lamp shade, since my apartment has
        some terrible overhead lighting. although i wanted to make it very weird and 
        organic looking. when i started mocking it up, i realized that i needed some 
        extra support to make sure that the leaves didn't fall off, so i started with only
        one leaf and mocked up a tab system that could fit inside the t-joints.
    </p>
    <div> 
        <img style = width:50%; src = "media/week2/combined-sketches.svg">
        <img style = width:30%; src = "media/week2/cutouts.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        the tiny tab has the width of the hypotenuse of the t-joints as its width so 
        that it can be slid in and still  be twisted into position to
        bind the connection firmly. <br><br>

        the harvard labs use illustrator as their print-manager and it took me a little
        bit of time to get a hang of it (i would love to be a good illustrator user, but 
        i'm not). once i got printing sorted, it took a few experimental prints, even 
        after measuring the cardboard carefully and including kerf reductions, to get a 
        perfect fit on the pieces.

        some notes here: illustrator likes sketches not arrangements, sadly!
    </p>

        <img style = width:30%; src = "media/week2/cutouts-1.jpg">
        <img style = width:30%; src = "media/week2/cutouts-2.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
        initially, things didn't fit together perfectly, but soon it was all fitting 
        quite snugly. <br><br>

        in the end, out of mostly laziness & time constraint, i decided to go with one 
        profile for the leaves  although i think it would have looked better if it was 
        more wild, strange, and organic.

        after assembly, it was shockingly sturdy, surviving a tumble and a ride down memorial drive without
        any discernible damage...

        the vinyl cut came out quite nicely with some interesting (but desirable) oddities in rastering
        from the hand-colored in pencil shading on the lettering
