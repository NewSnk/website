        this week the assignment was to design something big with bonus credit if we don't need to used
        fasteners or glue.<br><br>

        i've been waiting for this week because i still need a desk in my bedroom. i started by
        mocking up a desk in cad by defining parameters, creating the outline of one leg, and then
        copying it over and removing the shape of the interlocking tabs so that we are left with two 
        legs of the same shape and size with complementary cutouts. <br><br>

        here we had to be careful to define the extra space for the tool, called dog-bone cutouts.
        i parameterized this since we aren't sure exactly what tool we might be cutting with so that it can be dynamically changed later
        without messing up the geometry of the design.  
    </p>

    <p>
        i assembled the table in cad and then i realized that i just didn't like how visible the dogbones were
        in the final design and i also didn't like how the surface of the table would need dogbones too if my plan
        were to assemble the legs as they look in the renderings below. 
    </p>

    <p>      
        i wanted to challenge myself to make a design that hides or minizes the cutouts, so i started over
        with some hand sketching interlocking concepts that reduce the number of interlocking joints required, and/or 
        better hide the ones that were required.
    </p>
    <img style = width:40%; src = "media/week8/drawings.png">
    <p>
        some of these ideas included having access to a router table that i could set to the width of the table and cutting
        around the edges of the tabs, and i just don't think we're equipped to do this at the harvard reef,
        so i went with a slightly different approach and mocked it up in fusion360.
    </p>
    <img style = width:43%; src = "media/week8/sketch.png">
    <img style = width:29%; src = "media/week8/sketch-1.png">
    <p>
        i made sure to parameterize every value and then left these sketches 'messy' 
        (including the non-utilized parts of the circles) because it would allow me to change
        any of these dimensions later (based on how big the cnc and/or material and/or space i want
        to fit the desk into, is). after i did drawings of both leg 'types' i tested out the parameters
        by changing all of them sequentially to make sure that the geometry could be shifted without
        breaking, and it worked! <br><br>
        
        then i copied each leg twice, joined them, and started to design the top.
    </p>

    <img style = width:29%; src = "media/week8/short-legs.png">
    <p>
        i wanted to get rid of the issue in my first design, so i decided to simply route out half the width
        of the material so that it sits snuggly on top of the legs without exposing the legs on the desk
        surface. <br><br>

        i did this by placing the table top directly in the middle of the legs (this is also parameterized, so that
        if the width or length of the table changes that the top will still sit directly in the center), and 
        then i extruded the top of all the leg pieces up by the length of 1/2 * width_of_material. this way, i can
        ensure that this cad design will work for any tool diameter, any width of material, and any size desk! it should
        be 100% scaleable.

    <p>
        the last thing is to make the final dogteeth on the table top surface (underneath) and add a little bit of tolerance. since 
        we are working with the cheapest material (OSB) i didn't want to assume perfection so i added a small gap so that
        we can still fit the table top on with some minor imperfections (warping or chipping) on the sides of the OSB.

    <p>
        when we combine these parts, we have a table i'm reasonably pleased with!
