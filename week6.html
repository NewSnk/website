        this week was my first real shit-show week. <br><br>
        the goal was to mill our boards using the milling machines available at our respective labs. for the harvard lab, we had a 
        rolad srm-20

        in the lab training, i came a little bit late but it seemed like the group struggled to mill their first board using
        <a href="https://modsproject.org/">modsproject</a> design by neil gershenfeld and others. the interface looks like this for pcb milling
        on the rolad.

        when i came back the next day to mill my pcb, leo had written up a quite comprehensive <a href="https://github.com/leomcelroy/fab-notes/blob/main/MODS-SRM20.md">guide</a>
        to mods. after attempting to mill my boards, it was apparent that there was one serious omission from the guide which i'll note below. <br><br>

        pcb milling on the roland is two steps, one involves milling the traces (the surface etching) using a 1/64" endmill, and then the second step
        is to route out the board edges so that it's free from the sheet using a 1/32" endmill. the endmills are super small and delicate and luckily there
        is a massive supply, although i am told that they're not cheap (maybe $20/endmill). <br><br>
        
        i struggled with two things on mods. the first is that my edge cutout wasn't being recognized and i had to redo it a couple times from the kicad
        export. i'm still not exactly sure what i did differently, but there's this helpful "invert" button in mods that switches black to white and white to black
        and this helped get the right profile. the only thing to be aware of is that if the tolerances are tight, you might be shifting the border. for me this actually
        did end up being an issue because it cut in a little more than i would have liked.

    <a>
        don't tell neil (hi neil), but i ended up breaking two endmills because of one small missing step which was not hitting the calculate button
        on mods again after setting the origin. this meant that when i was routing out the border, that the endmill when straight through the piece and
        into the plate below. the worst part is that i adjusted and tried again without consulting with the tas and made the same mistake twice, sacrificing
        two 1/32" endmills and a tiny piece of the plate too. <br><br>

        anyway, i successfully milled the pcb on the third try after recalculating and then i had still a pretty mediocre result because the border
        was too tight, but since it was a practice anyway, i thought it was fine to solder on.

        i was then overconfident on my soldering skills and i'm sure than many of these connections are not great, but it was really good to practice. the biggest
        issue here was that the harvard lab has none of the parts in the "fab" library so we actually had nothing i could really work with which meant that i ended up
        trying to solder an rgb led that required through-holes directly to the pad (just for practice, dumb i know), and i had to solder on an rp2040 because we didnt 
        have any esp32s. i double checked that the output pins for the rp2040 would work (with some coding adjustments and i think they should 
        have worked! based on diagramming) <br><br>

        the rp2040 has data pins in the same place as the esp32 w, as well as power and ground in the same places, so my take was that it should be
        interchangeable for this very basic application where wifi among other uses weren't required...

    <p> 
        anyway i soldered the parts on, and while i felt like i was getting better and smoother with each solder, i'm not sure about the quality
        of the connections.

        once satisfied, plugged it in and loaded the micropython interpretor to the xiao rp2040 and then 
        sent it a quick line of code to test the onboard led (just making the led blink red).
