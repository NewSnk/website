        we began the course with a simple design project in the CAD program or programs 
        of choice and the assignment was to draw up and render our final project.     
        i started out by sketching some ideas on pad and paper, some of them a little bit
        more likely to be completed than others. <br> <br>

        after finding some interesting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Crystal-Sheet-20-25C-Transition/dp/B009P8CRZO/ref=asc_df_B009P8CRZO/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=647264350441&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13329785633627610852&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1018145&hvtargid=pla-1953067000033&psc=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwjaWoBhAmEiwAXz8DBYJsJkiWhOWsJHP75pUZP64i6c342chbFdMbbQISg4UoSB4io-IvuBoCloIQAvD_BwE"> 
        liquid-crystal sheets</a> that could be cool for the mood-changing designs i 
        had sketched, i decided to move forward and mock up a <b>color-changing-oven</b>. 
        the idea is that the liquid-crystal sheets could be reactive at the right temperature
        to bake a perfect neopolitan (sue me) pizza!

    <div> 
        <img src = "media/week1/thermo-sens-sheet-1.png" >
        <img style= width:40%; src = "media/week1/thermo-sens-sheet.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        i drew up an parametrically designed sketch of the oven in fusion360, careful to 
        test that each of the parameters could change and the constraints were defined 
        carefully enough that fusion360 knew how to re-draw. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <div> 
        <img style= width:40%; src = "media/week1/fusion-screenshot-2.png">
        <img style= width:40%; src = "media/week1/fusion-screenshot.png">
    </div>

    <p>
        i felt as if the rendering in fusion360 could use some upgrading so 
        i brought it into blender and did some colorizing to show my vision for how the 
        liquid-crystal sheets might be applied  <br> <br>
    </p>

        <img style= width:50%; src = "media/week1/blender-screenshot.png">

    <p>
        and that is all for week 1!
