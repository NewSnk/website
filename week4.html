        this week we did 3d printing and scanning and honestly, i was too busy to do a dedicated
        job this week but here's what we did! <br><br>

        i just bought a wacom tablet for drawing so i wanted to experminent a little bit with the
        tablet and blender. 

        i started by drawing a 3d rendering of a hand in blender. it looks a little bit creepy, 
        but it is modeled after my own long fingers after all.

    </p>

    <div> 
        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/hand0.png">
        <img style = width:21%; src = "media/week4/hand00.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        i wanted to play around with some of the features in blender so i was working on curving
        and moving the geometry to bend the hand in some interesting ways. 

        i wanted to turn it into a vase so i designed a cylinder and a square to sit inside
        of the model to create space for a flower to come out, looking like that hand just
        picked it.

        here's a cute visual of what i wanted it to look like.
    </p>
    <div> 
        <img style = width:23%; src = "media/week4/hand000.png">
        <img style = width:19%; src = "media/week4/hand_flower.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        the design process in blender and with the wacom went well and was super satisfying
        but when i went to slice it on the prusa slicer, it looked fine but sliced with big gaps.

    </p>
    <div> 
        <img style = width:40%; src = "media/week4/prusa.png">
        <img style = width:21%; src = "media/week4/prusa2.png">
        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/prusa3.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        i think this is just my immaturity with blender because i made some mistakes with
        the geometry and probably lost some planes. anyway, i ended up cutting off the bottom
        so that i could print it anyway because i wanted to see how it looked.

        i figured it could be an interesting and happy coincidence with a little support to look 
        floating, also.
        <br><br>

        i realized that of course it looks like this, because look at my reference!
    </p>
    <div> 
        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/hand-print.jpg">
        <img style = width:15%; src = "media/week4/myhand.jpg">
    </div>

    <p>
        the hand cannot be subtractive made because of the reservoir within.
    </p>
    <div> 
        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/reservoir-pic.png">
    </div>
    <p>
        the prints came out quite nicely and support structures weren't horrible to remove.
        i got lucky on my way to class this morning and found the perfect flowers for the display!

        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/final-hand.jpg">

        the other assignment this week was to do a 3d scanning experiment. both mit and havard 
        have the <a href="https://www.artec3d.com/portable-3d-scanners/artec-leo">artec leo</a>,
        a shockingly expensive ($35k!) handheld bluetooth scanner capable of scanning 
        almost anything in about thirty seconds. <br><br>

        <img style = width:20%; src = "media/week4/artec-leo.png">

    </div>

        anyway, i scanned a laser cut chair to see if the visual scan could be inceptioned into 
        a second chair. i didn't do it this week, and probably realistically will never do it,
        but it seems more than possible!

        its much heavier than i expected and while the interface is extremely useable,
        what i found pretty annoying is how it requires proprietary software to use, and 
        the files generated are absolutely huge. this scan of a very simple laser cut chair
        about 5 inches wide was over 1.6GB.  <br><br>

        the software itself you have to pay a subscription for even after buying the 
        hardware. i tried to do it on my own computer and artec won't let me try a free trial even.
        harvard's work around is to buy an entirely new dedicated computer which i find a bit
        ridiculous. <br><br>

        so i also tried a scan using Polycam on my phone. it worked ok for this pen.. but not great!
