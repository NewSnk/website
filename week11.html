        this week the assignment was to interface between two systems. because i've been working on this lamp design from the the molding and casting week,
        i wanted to use this week and next week to build an internal support structure to hold some electronics, interface with my computer and allow
        the user to control the light from their computer. i want to have the control to turn it both on and off, and color it, and ideally i want to 
        do both of those things from any wifi connection. i knew i had my work cut out for me because i also need to make some small changes to the mold to
        get everything to fit together perfectly. <br><br>

        again, i started with the xiao esp32-s3 because its the wifi enabled board that we have in stock !

    <p>

        to test out the network code, and because we have precious few esp32s in stock, i started by setting one up on a breadboard.

        arduino code is <a href="media/week11/test-esp32-s3.ino"></a>here and html code is <a href="media/week11/hello.ws-blink.js.html">here</a> but truth be told
        it's almost entirely ripped off from neil's <a href="https://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/networking_communications/bus/hello.bus.45.node">code</a> with very few changes. <br><br>
    </p>
    <video controls autoplay="none" muted width="200">
        <source  src="media/week11/network-breadboard.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>  
    <p>
        now that i have confidence, i moved on to fusion360 and kicad to develop an internal structure and boards that fit inside my mold.  
        i drew pieces that would fit inside the base, secure the top, and hold the microcontroller, button, and led, securely and in place inside the design.

    <img style = width:45%; src = "media/week11/cover.png">
    <p>
        all together, the piece looks like this.

    <img style = width:35%; src = "media/week11/final-lamp-1.png">
    <p>
        i started by printing out the 3d printed parts. 
    </p>
    <img style = width:45%; src = "media/week11/3d-print.jpg">
    <p>
        and then designed in kicad so that i could separate the components and have the board and button fit perfectly.

    <p>
        and i finally used quentin bolsee's <a href="https://quentinbolsee.pages.cba.mit.edu/gerber2img/">brilliant gerber conversion tool</a>. 
    </p>
    <img style = width:45%; src = "media/week11/gerber.png">
    <p>
        then i milled out my boards and they fit perfectly!
